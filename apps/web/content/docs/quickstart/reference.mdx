## Utility Commands

### `flash`

Inspired from `neofetch`, this displays basic information about the VoltX installation and user stats if configured.

```bash
voltx flash
```

This command provides a quick overview, potentially including the user alias and creation date if the configuration exists.

### `list-providers`

Lists all the AI providers currently supported by VoltX.

```bash
voltx list-providers
```

This helps you see which services (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) you can potentially configure.

### `list-models`

Lists the AI models supported by VoltX, optionally filtered by a specific provider.

**List all models:**

```bash
voltx list-models
```

**List models for a specific provider (e.g., OpenAI):**

```bash
voltx list-models --provider openai
```

This command shows the available model identifiers (e.g., `gpt-4`, `claude-3-opus`) you can use during configuration or chat sessions.

## Configuration Commands

### `show-defaults`

Displays the default provider and model currently set in your configuration.

```bash
voltx config show-defaults
```

<Callout>
	This command reads from your existing `config.toml`. If no configuration or
	defaults are set, it may show empty values.
</Callout>

### `setup chat-model`

Sets the default AI model to be used for chat sessions when no specific provider or model is specified.

```bash
voltx config setup chat-model --provider <provider-name>
```

You need to specify the provider whose model you want to set as default using the `--provider` flag.

### `setup provider`

Configures the API key and other settings for AI providers.

**Interactive Setup:**

If run without specifying a provider, it presents an interactive menu to select and configure a provider.

```bash
voltx config setup provider
```

**Direct Setup for a Specific Provider:**

Configures a specific provider directly by using its corresponding flag.

```bash
voltx config setup provider --<provider-name>
```

Replace `<provider-name>` with the actual provider you want to configure (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`). This command will guide you through setting up the selected provider.

### `show config`

Displays the entire content of your `config.toml` file.

**Show configuration (masked keys):**

```bash
voltx show config
```

**Show configuration (unmasked keys):**

```bash
voltx show config --unmasked
```

<Callout title="Security Warning">
	Using the `--unmasked` flag will display your API keys in plain text in the
	terminal output. Be cautious when using this option, especially in shared
	environments.
</Callout>

## Destructive Commands

### `reset-defaults`

Resets the default provider and model settings in your configuration file.

```bash
voltx config reset-defaults
```

<Callout title="Requires Confirmation">
	This command modifies your configuration file (`~/.voltx/config.toml`).
</Callout>

### `reset`

Completely resets your VoltX setup by deleting the entire configuration directory (`~/.voltx`).

```bash
voltx reset
```

<Callout title="Irreversible Action">
	This is a destructive operation and cannot be undone. It removes your
	`config.toml`, saved chats, logs, cache, and temporary files.
</Callout>
