VoltX Chat provides an interactive command-line interface to converse with various AI models you have configured. It allows for seamless switching between providers and models.

## Starting a Chat Session

You can initiate a chat session in several ways:

### Default Chat

Starts a chat session using your configured default provider and model. If no defaults are set, VoltX may prompt you or use the first available configured provider.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx chat" />

### Chat with a Specific Provider

Starts a chat session using a specific provider. VoltX will use the default model configured for that provider, or prompt you if none is set.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx chat <provider-name>" />

Replace `<provider-name>` with the provider you want to use (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`).

### Temporary Model Selection

Starts a chat session with a specific provider but forces a temporary model selection for this session only. This overrides any configured defaults for the duration of the chat.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx chat <provider-name> --temp" />

Replace `<provider-name>` with the provider you want to use. VoltX will prompt you to select a model from that provider for this specific session.

<Callout>
	Chat history is saved locally within your `.voltx` directory, allowing you
	to resume conversations later (feature details may vary).
</Callout>
