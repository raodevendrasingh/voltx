## Overview

VoltX Agent Mode acts as an intelligent assistant directly in your terminal. You provide instructions in natural language, and the agent suggests a corresponding shell command. You can then review, approve, and execute the command.

## Starting an Agent Session

You can initiate an agent session in several ways, similar to Chat Mode:

### Default Agent

Starts an agent session using your configured default provider and model. If no defaults are set, VoltX will prompt you to configure them or select temporary options.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx agent" />

### Agent with a Specific Provider

Starts an agent session using a specific provider. VoltX will use the default model configured for that provider, or prompt you if none is set.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx agent <provider-name>" />

Replace `<provider-name>` with the provider you want to use (e.g., `google`, `openai`).

### Temporary Model Selection

Starts an agent session with a specific provider but forces a temporary model selection for this session only. This overrides any configured defaults for the duration of the agent session.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="voltx agent <provider-name> --temp" />

Replace `<provider-name>` with the provider you want to use. VoltX will prompt you to select a model from that provider for this specific session.

## Using the Agent

Once activated, the agent will prompt you for input in your current directory.

1.  **Enter Command:** Type your desired action in natural language (e.g., "list all typescript files", "create a new directory called temp").
2.  **Review Suggestion:** The agent will process your input and suggest a shell command.
3.  **Confirm Execution:** You will be asked to confirm whether you want to run the suggested command.
4.  **Execute (or Skip):** If confirmed, the command runs, and its output is displayed. If skipped, the agent waits for your next input.
5.  **Exit:** Type `exit` or `quit` to end the agent session.

### Command History

Within an active agent session, you can access previously entered natural language prompts:

- Type `!h` and press Enter.
- A list of recent prompts will be displayed.
- Select a prompt from the list to rerun it.

<Callout>
	The natural language prompts you enter are saved locally in your
	`.voltx/cache` directory. This history is used for the `!h` command feature.
</Callout>
